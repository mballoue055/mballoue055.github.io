	<p>School: Lawndale High School.</p>
<p>Classes: No Fisrt, English 11, Computer Scince Principles, Algebra 2, SAT PREP, Physics, US History, and Football VAR.</p>
<p>Something about me: I am a 11th grader that just transfered to Lawndale. The school I went to before I can here had two semesters worth a year course, so that means I have way more credits than a normal 11th grader should have. If i wanted i could graduate this year when i pass all my classes. Im on the football team playing with JV right now so that i can learn more about the game because i havent plaed tackle football since i was 9 and im currently 16.</p>
